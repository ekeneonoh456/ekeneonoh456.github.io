# Building Portfolio Website

This project consisted of creating a portfolio website from scratch using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Additionally, Google Apps Script was used, for backend functionality to integrate the site with Google Spreadsheets. The purpose of the site is to showcase my skills in web development and ability to integrate external services and APIs along with a hub to show my IT and cybersecurity projects and experience.

## Lessons Learned

I was able to gain more experience and comfort with HTML and CSS along with the many intricacies of the features each language consists of. The project also introduced me to Google Apps Script. I was so intrigued by its resourcefulness that I hope to utilize it again sometime in the future. 

There were multiple moments where I attempted to be creative and experimental with the page design which led to many instances of either glitches, bugs, or unwanted results. However, I did my research to find solutions and overcome these obstacles. In addition to finding solutions, there were also times when removing an idea or component of the code was the best option. It is important to sometimes work smarter and not harder. The best solutions are not always the overcomplicated ones. Since, I will be constantly updating the page, there will be more opportunities to grow and develop not only this site, but my knowledge of web development.
